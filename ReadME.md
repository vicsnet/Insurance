---------------- NEON GUARD DEFI INSURANCE  ------------------------

Getting started

Neon Guard was built to tranform insurance on the blockchain. Neon Guard is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows members to join and share risk. Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. The Neon Guard protocol provides the infrastructure for members to buy cover, underwrite risk, assess claims, and build risk managed portfolios.

The Neon Guard DAO operates as a discretionary mutual - people can join, share risk, and enjoy the benefits of membership.
