---------------- *NEON GUARD DEFI INSURANCE*  ------------------------

*Getting started*

Neon Guard was built to tranform insurance on the blockchain. Neon Guard is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows members to join and share risk. Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. The Neon Guard protocol provides the infrastructure for members to buy cover, assess claims, and build risk managed portfolios.

The Neon Guard DAO operates as a discretionary mutual - people can join, share risk, and enjoy the benefits of membership. The DAO stands as the central decision making body for the protocol. DAO members can create new insurance cover, assess claim, vote for or against a claim, and also share in the incentives for keeping the protocol growing.

*What we Cover*

1. Custody cover
Crypto assets held in custodial accounts on an exchange are held in wallets that users do not have access to, hence do not have control over.

Users run the risk of a loss due to a custodial wallet hack or the potential for withdrawals to be halted without notice, or the centralized exchange going bankrupt, which would prevent users from accessing their funds on the centralized exchange.
