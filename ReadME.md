---------------- **NEON GUARD DEFI INSURANCE**  ------------------------

*Getting started*

Neon Guard was built to tranform insurance on the blockchain. Neon Guard is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows members to join and share risk. Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. The Neon Guard protocol provides the infrastructure for members to buy cover, assess claims, and build risk managed portfolios.

The Neon Guard DAO operates as a discretionary mutual - people can join, share risk, and enjoy the benefits of membership. The DAO stands as the central decision making body for the protocol. DAO members can create new insurance cover, assess claim, vote for or against a claim, and also share in the incentives for keeping the protocol growing.

*What we Cover*

1. Custody cover
Crypto assets held in custodial accounts on an exchange are held in wallets that users do not have access to, hence do not have control over.

Users run the risk of a loss due to a custodial wallet hack or the potential for withdrawals to be halted without notice, or the centralized exchange going bankrupt, which would prevent users from accessing their funds on the centralized exchange. Users are protected from this risk when they subscribe to our custody cover.

How it works:

Subscribers can claim custody cover in any of the these conditions:
i. A hack on the custodial wallet or exchange used by the subscriber that leads to loss of more than 10% of the subscriber's funds.

ii. An unannounced halting of withdrawal on the custodian platform that exceeds more than 90 days. 

iii. A sudden declare of bankrupcy by the custodian that make no prior announcement for users to withdraw their assets, and did not make any announcement to refund users at any time in the future.
